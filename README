crates to consider

mempool by Andrew Gallant



Compile with MIR support using
RUSTFLAGS="-Z orbit"

Use when running tests to limit concurrency
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1

Remove use of RefCell in these compositons:
Arc<Mutex<RefCell<>>>

Cell, RefCell, UnsafeCell do not share across threads
as they aren't Sync

impl can be split across multple files
might be good to put test-enabled code in separate files
e.g., segment.rs segment_test.rs
or move them to tests/ entirely

doc comments PRECEDE the item they refer to
struct Type {
    var: usize, /// comment actually for var2!
    var2: usize,
}
should be
struct Type {
    /// var is cool
    var: usize,
    /// var2 is cooler
    var2: usize,
}
